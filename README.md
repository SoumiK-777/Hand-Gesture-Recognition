# Personalized Hand Gestures Recognition for Controlling Vehicle Infotainment

Traditional interfaces for vehicle infotainment systems, such as physical buttons or touchscreens, often cause distractions and may not always be the most user-friendly or convenient, especially while driving. These distractions can compromise driver safety and reduce the overall driving experience.

To address these issues, we propose the development of a personalized hand gesture recognition system utilizing computer vision and artificial intelligence (AI) techniques. Our solution aims to provide a seamless and intuitive user experience by enabling drivers to control infotainment functions through natural hand movements.

## Proposed Solution

To address the challenge of traditional vehicle infotainment interfaces, we propose a personalized hand gesture recognition system based on few-shot learning. Few-shot learning enables a model to learn and make accurate predictions from a limited number of training examples. In this context, drivers will provide only a few samples of their personalized hand gestures, and our model will be able to recognize and predict these gestures with high accuracy.
